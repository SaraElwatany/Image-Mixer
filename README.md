# Image (Phase & Magnitude) Mixer

# Abstract
The above project was a collaborative university project, where we used "Fourier Transform" to extract the Phase & Magnitude of two input images chosen by the user and then they are both plotted in separate adjacent images. The user is able to select which part of the phase and magnitude to extract for each inpute image and then the output image will be a combination of the user's choice, the output image is supposed to look more like the image that it used its phase as it will have more information than just the magnitude, moreover it will look dimmer if the user chose the magnitude far away from the center and will get more luminous as you get towards the center of the magnitude. The above web-base application has several options where the user can not only draw one selection area for the phase or magnitude but also can draw several ones and can choose to get the resultant of that choice as  "Logical OR" or "Logical AND" or "Logical XOR" or "Logical NAND" or "Logical NOR".
